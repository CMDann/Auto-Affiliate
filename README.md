Auto-Affiliate
==============

This chrome extension allows you to have users automatically affiliate with your website. You can edit the affiliate ID to be whatever your ID is (default mine). Currently this supports:
<ul>
  <li>Amazon.ca</li>
</ul>

Other programs will be added.

How To Use
==========

To use this you will need to first register for an affiliate program of your choice. By default the extension uses my Amazon.ca affiliate ID. You can of course add any sites you want by editing the code.

Edit my ID out with your own.
